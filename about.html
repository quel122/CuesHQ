        <p class="center">Greetings! My name is Marquel Greene and I am from Douglasville, GA. I want to revolutionize the next era of technological entertainment! As a child, I was always intrigued by the newest software and hardware. On top of that, my dad is a troubleshooter and a fellow gamer so it is only fitting that my passion is in the field of technology. Currently, I am a student at the Thinkful Bootcamp learning new skills that will improve the overall quality of my technical skills. I am willing to take on new projects and work with other critical thinkers to create great product. This site will be the hub of my efforts to showcase the most enoyable websites, graphics, music, and video games. I will gradually build my portfolio below:</p>

            This is my first full blown project and I can't wait to work on more! I used a repl to write my HTML and CSS and trnsferred the code to this <a href="https://github.com/quel122/CuesHQ">Github Repo</a>. It's currently being hosted as a live site <a href="https://quel122.github.io/CuesHQ/">here</a>.
